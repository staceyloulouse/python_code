This is the code for the project oriented programming for beginners book called Python Code Course by Stacey Loulouse. Each project will help to progress the user from being a spectator to a spectaclar developer. Follow along with the code reviews on YouTube, learn the syntax along the way,  and do the activities and assessments in the book to become familiar with project development from start to finish. Working with a code base is a sure fire way to get the knowledge of coding without getting inundated with errors and challenges from the start. This is a fool-proof way to learn how to code in 2021 and beyond.

Project One - The first project is a desktop application that provides the user with basic calculator functions. The screen shows arithmetic operations, 10 digits for input, equal button to calculate, and a clear button.
Project Two - The second project is an application that provides the usere the ability to practice math facts in a game-like way. Random numbers pop up, and the user selects the prime numbers that are factors of the number. 
Project Three - The third project is a photo gallery app that allows the user to browse photo gallery. There is a next and previous button.
Project Four - The fourth project incorporates a database and makes use of other widgets in the tkinter resource.
